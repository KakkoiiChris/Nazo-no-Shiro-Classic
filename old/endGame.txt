"This door is different from the rest...
		Surely I must be dreaming..."

	It's a slightly larger door than the rest, wooden, yet all 
that adorns it are iron rivets and bands. There is a small 
window of sorts towards the top. You get on tiptoe to get a
better view. 

	As you get closer and closer, you begin to see a familiar
and welcome sight, one you hadn't seen since... well who 
how long it has been. It would fill even the most hardened 
of people with an uncontrollable feeling of joy.

	"Green... GRASS!"
	
	The doors suddenly unlatch by themselves, causing you to 
fall over. Thankfully, the soft, warm ground softens your
landing. As you lay there, you take a generously deep breath
as you revel in your victory.

	You finally lift yourself off the ground, and all around
you, the land is speckled with cherry blossoms in full bloom.
A large, snow-capped mountain peaks above a pine forest far
off in the distance.The silhouette of several japanese pagodas 
loom over the cliffside.

	"This is why I love Japan."
	
	However, despite the lovely view, something begins to 
distract you from your celebration. Yet another feeling begins 
to overshadow your joy, a feeling you haven't felt in a long
time. A feeling of disorientation. A feeling of panic.

	A feeling of puzzlement.
	
"........ Where am I?"
