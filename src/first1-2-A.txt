	You wake up... slowly... your vision is blurred, and your
cheek is moist. You can't discern anything, but the cold, 
harsh floor greets your hands as you try to stand upright.
As your vision grows clearer, the harder it is to take in 
your surroundings. 
	
	It's a fairly large room: stone on all the walls, and 
plank wood on the floor and ceiling. The room is barely lit 
by the dim light of oriental-style lanterns. Each wall sports
a wooden door emblazoned with brass dragons, as well as 
posters with strange characters on them. 

	You think to yourself, "Where am I?". You Reach into your
pocket for clues, and pull out a ticket. 

One look and it hits you.....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Salesperson]: Alright, here's your ticket. Please place 
               this sticker around the handle of your 
               suitcase, and we'll handle it for you.
					
        [You]: Ok... *rustle* ...here...thank you sir!
		  
[Salesperson]: Ok, now... *rip!* ... if you could just write
               your name, gender, and date of birth here...
